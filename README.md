# EyeState-Analysis-Using-SnowFlake

## 🚀 Project Overview

EyeState-Analysis-Using-SnowFlake is a data analytics project that analyzes the Eye State Dataset using Snowflake — a cloud-native data platform. The analysis is performed inside a Jupyter Notebook (SnowFlake.ipynb) and demonstrates how to load, transform, and explore data using Snowflake’s features and Python.

This project can be used as a reference for integrating machine learning datasets with Snowflake and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insight generation within the cloud data warehouse environment.

 ## 🧠 Key Features

✔️ Load the Eye State dataset into Snowflake
✔️ Use Snowflake’s Python integration for data processing
✔️ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
✔️ Showcase Snowflake analytics workflows using a Jupyter Notebook

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have:

- A Snowflake account
- Python (preferably 3.8+)
- Required Python libraries installed:
pip install snowflake-connector-python snowflake-snowpark-python pandas matplotlib seaborn
- Credentials to connect your Python environment to Snowflake

 ## 🚀 Getting Started
1 Clone the repository

- git clone https://github.com/gowthamx25/EyeState-Analysis-Using-SnowFlake.git
- cd EyeState-Analysis-Using-SnowFlake
  
2 Open the Notebook

- Open SnowFlake.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
  
3 Configure Snowflake Connection

- Provide your Snowflake credentials and connection details (account, username, password, role, warehouse, database, schema) in the notebook.
  
4 Run the Cells

- Execute the cells step-by-step to load data, explore the dataset, and visualize patterns in eye states.

### 📊 What You’ll Analyze

#### The Eye State Dataset typically contains:

- Features representing eye openness and related measurements
- A target label indicating whether the eye is open (0) or closed (1)
- Using Snowflake and Python, the notebook demonstrates: Loading and storing data in Snowflake tables
- Querying and transforming data using Snowflake tools
- Visualizing distributions and relationships
- Drawing insights for real-world machine learning analysis

### 🧪 Notes

- This project is ideal for learning how to perform cloud analytics using Snowflake and Python.
- You can extend it by adding machine learning models or real-time data pipelines.
